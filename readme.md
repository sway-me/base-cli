# sway home

## Requirements
- A Debian Server with a sudo user. Just follow the debian graphical install guide and you should be fine. 
- A purchased domain, where you can add A records using a DNS service. Namecheap is recommended.

## Nice-to-haves
Namecheap API Access. Buying 20 cheap tlds with your domain (eg mydomain.website) is worth the money, especially when they are under a dollar.  

You will need
  - Namecheap API Key
  - Whitelist you IP in your Namecheap account settings. See [this](https://github.com/Bemmu/PyNamecheap)  guide
